<p>This image took me 5 hours upload. I'm not kidding. Anyway this would be my most prized guitar. A Gibson J-160e. I got this back in the day when you can buy from Guitar Centers back shop website where you can buy a guitar from a store in another state.</p>
   <p> The model I got was the John Lennon 2000 model. I hope to find a 2010 imagine model one day in the future. However affording it is going to be a huge challenge</p>
